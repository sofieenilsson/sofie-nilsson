					<p>Create a campaign/marketing activity that can be part of a bigger launch campaign for <a class="fade-out darken" href="http://schoolido.se/" target="blank">Schoolido</a>. The campaign should build awareness around the brand and be viral so it can live on the internet.</p>

					<h2 class="headline">Project</h2>
					<p>Schoolido is a learning platform created for today’s pupils with the aim to meet them in the digital world where they already exist. Schoolido stands for democratic learning which means that we all have various learning styles. Some of us prefer to watch videos; some prefer to read texts, some want to listen to someone reading a text and some like to learn by doing quiz. </p>

					<h2 class="headline">Insights</h2>
					<p>Today it's more or less companies that place Sweden on the map. Often when people brag it is about the success for Swedish brands, companies and/or startups. But bragging can also lead to different reactions. When we brag about something personal it is seen as something negative, it's self-absorbed and provocative. When we brag about someone or for Sweden it is positive, you are showing your proudness. As a Swede you're not expected to brag, but when we are bragging we get a feeling of being proud, we get a rush.</p>

					<h2 class="headline">Concept</h2>
					<p>From these insights we came up with a one word proposition for our concept: proud, which led us up to our concept: Make people brag more. We came up with an idea that focuses on the manifesto and the startup industry, it both engage people and encourage them to spread the word about SUP46 and their mission.</p>

					<h2 class="headline">The Brag Generator</h2>
					<p>A generator that encourages people to brag by taking a humble sentence and making it as braggy as possible. The reason behind this generator is to make people feel better when bragging by making it a fun and social thing. The generator will have a big social media attention, that will make people aware of the manifesto and make that active decision to make a change.</p>

						<p>The sentence generated from the Brag Generator is easy to share in social media. This gives the campaign a high spread potential and a huge social media attention. You will also be able to see the original sentence from before the generator worked its magic.</p>

					<h2 class="headline">Goal</h2>
					<p>The main goal is to make people sign the manifesto. To be able to reach this goal we first need to bring attention to the problem, the problem of people not bragging enough. We want to inspire people to dare to speak about things they are proud of, and make them feel proud of their accomplishments.</p>
